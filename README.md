# Assignment

Meet with your group and develop a solution based on the Final Project outline provided on Canvas. Your group will then propose that idea in your proposal. Make sure to follow the rubric. I have provided an overview of the ruburic here, but please visit the assignment in Canvas for more details. Remember, your proposal is "selling" your idea. Clearly outline what you wish to do and then backup anything you say with references.
